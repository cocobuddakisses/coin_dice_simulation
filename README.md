# 🎲 Coin Toss & Dice Roll Simulation
This project explores how probability distributions emerge through random experiments by simulating two classic scenarios:

Repeated coin tosses

Repeated dice rolls

## ✅ Goals
Simulate random processes (fair coin flips & dice rolls)

Visualize outcome distributions for different sample sizes

Demonstrate the Law of Large Numbers: Show how increasing the number of trials makes the results converge to theoretical probabilities

## 📈 What’s included
### 1️⃣ Coin Toss Simulation

Toss a fair coin multiple times (10, 100, 1,000, 10,000, 100,000 tosses)

Visualize how often you get Heads vs Tails

Plot how the proportion of Heads and Tails gets closer to 50% as the number of tosses increases

### 2️⃣ Dice Roll Simulation

Roll a fair six-sided die multiple times (10, 100, 1,000, 10,000, 100,000 rolls)

Visualize the distribution of numbers 1–6

Show how the outcome frequencies flatten into a uniform distribution as the sample size grows

## 🔬 Key Concepts Demonstrated
Random sampling & simulation using numpy

Probability distributions for discrete random events

Law of Large Numbers: How larger samples produce results closer to expected probabilities

Visualization using seaborn and matplotlib

Basic data manipulation with pandas

## 📌 How to Run
Clone the repo or download the .ipynb files.

Open them in Jupyter Notebook or Google Colab.

Run each notebook top to bottom to reproduce the simulations and plots.

## ✨ Key Takeaway
This project shows how randomness and probability theory align as sample size increases.
Small samples are noisy and can look unfair — large samples balance out and reveal the true underlying distribution.
